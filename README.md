#============Framework===============
This website fontend is running with 
- React + ReactRouter
- Bootstrap

In the zip file i will also include the node_modules library that required
But if you want ensure library works normal, you can run "npm install" in "IERG4210 assignment/my-app"

to start with, you need to use nodejs.
when you installed npm, use "npm start" in "frontend" to host the web
when you installed npm, use "npm start" in "backend" to host the backend node server

In order to ensure correct, i screenshot some page and put on the file for you to see it runs correctly.

#============CSS===================
As i used Bootstrap as my styling framework, many styles will run by class
but in order to help assignment, i also write some basic css stylesheet in style.css

#============Project page===========
As it is phase 1, and i asked professor and he allowed, to reduce time i only make 3 product pages(as i have more then 10 products)
So i make one product page for each categories, different product in same categories will share same product page.
